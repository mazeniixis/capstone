    <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
    <p>

        I've coded in a variety of different languages.  My first programming language was old HTML when I was in high school. <br />
        My second language that I learned was C/C++, which I learned at Riverside Community College.  At first I struggled with the concepts, but when I attended BYU, I understood it more than I did years prior. <br />
        I've learned a bit of assembly language (which I've largely forgotten as I didn't use it often enough to make a difference) while at BYU. <br />
        My knowledge of C# is largely self-taught.  Space Engineers ingame scripting uses C#, and I was motivated to learn C# because it gave me a perfect environment to learn, train, and hone my programming skills. <br />
        I'm also familiar with Python scripting language.  I wouldn't claim to be proficient at it, but I have programmed in it to a degree and plan on improving it. <br />
        My goal is to expand on my programming repertoire with more knowledge of web development, C#, C++, and other languages so that I can call on the skills when needed. <br />

    <h2>Visual Art Experience</h2>
    <p>
        My experience with visual art is many and varied.  While in High School, I studied Graphic Design in 9th grade using outdated software that was available at the time. <br />
        Later, I took photography class using Photoshop 7, which at the time was the latest Adobe Photoshop available at the time.  Prior to that, I've played around with a demo of Photoshop 5.  Many of the works I've done in it have been lost. <br />
        In my 11th grade, I took TV production class, and studied about the procedure for producing TV. <br />
        I have many experience using 3D software.  My first software that I used is called TrueSpace 3.2, which I no longer use. <br />
        I've used Draw3D, Anim8or, and several others.  Which I no longer utilize. <br />
        While I was at Riverside Community College, I took additional classes that helped me develop some experience in arts.  It was when I first used Maya 2008. <br />
        I took Photoshop class, which at the time was CS3.  I also studied Illustrator and fulfilled projects in it. <br />
        The single program that I used the most is Blender 3D as it can be acquired at no cost, but it have steep learning curves.  At the time that I first started out with Blender 3D, it was version 2.42, and doesn't have many of the features that it have and tutorials available at the time is limited. <br />
        I also learned how to use Photoshop CS6, which I still mainly use and prefer over Photoshop CC because I do not have to pay subscription and I own it perpetually. <br />

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm legally Deaf from birth.  My experience as a Deaf person in a Hearing World have taught me how to interact with others who do not communicate the same as I do. <br />
        I also recognized that communication barrier is a real thing, and I had to find workarounds.  My preferred method is through written methods or sign language if the other person knows it. <br />
        With computers, the communication barrier is completely removed and I can freely correspond with others regardless of their language.  Spoken words are not necessary as written words are best through computers. <br />
        Hence, my goal is to work with computers, because I love to solve problems, I find computer programming to be more to my likings, and I aim to be a professional developer/programmer. <br />
        Even though I'm Deaf, I still enjoy music, but I cannot hear spoken words.
